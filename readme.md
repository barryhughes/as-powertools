Power Tools for Action Scheduler
--------------------------------

To install, simply clone (or copy) the repository to your plugin directory (typically, this is `wp-content/plugins/`). Then, run `npm run build`. After activation, you should find that the existing **Tools â–¸ Scheduled Actions** screen now has an option to open powertools, which will lead to:

- A settings panel, from which various performance characteristics can be managed.
- A diagnostics panel, which may be helpful when assessing the health of your action queue.

This plugin is not production ready, and is at least partly a proof-of-concept.
